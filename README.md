# trainScheduler
This is a very basic transportation tracking app.
Works in browser.
Even though WebApp says rideUTA, as long as you know the first start time, destination and frequency of the transportation, you should be able to use any transportation system everywhere.
Next arrival time for trax/bus will automatically update.
